# Image-Caption-Generator

This is web based project that involves computer vision.with the help of CNN-RNN model image caption generator has been built.
LSTM an improved version of RNN helped a lot in providing a sequence of words in the caption generation.
with the help of cnn a feature vector for the images is generated then that feature vector along with the image is put into the LSTM model to generate
relevant caption.
Flask has been used as the backend to make this a web based project.
The Caption along with the Image is displayed to the user as a result.
